# WPCabLinks.db

This repo contains .txt lists with download links with Update Cabs for many many different WP Builds! 
*Please be aware I haven't tested any of these yet, just filtered the links to each build so it's up to the user to know how to install and debug any issues installing*

## Notes:

- Some lists will just be Language packs.
- Some builds (17xxx) are for Hololens


### Canonical - 
"Full" packages like when OTC Updater is used to manually update a Device

### Delta - 
These are "Update" packages, you will need to be on the build Specified on a Delta Folder, example:
`10.0.14903.1000 (rs_prerelease.160809-1700)\Delta (10.0.14902.1000 (rs_prerelease.160808-1700))`

You will need to be on build `10.0.14902.1000 (rs_prerelease.160808-1700)` before using the `Delta 10.0.14903.1000 (rs_prerelease.160809-1700)` packages.
